TASK 1: THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

QUESTION 1: Explain how Edge AI reduces latency and enhances privacy compared to cloud-based AI. Provide a real-world example (e.g., autonomous drones).

ANSWERS:
-Edge AI means running AI directly on local devices like phones or drones, not in the cloud.
-Less Latency: Data doesn’t travel far, so decisions are faster. This is important for things like drones avoiding obstacles quickly.
-More Privacy: Data stays on the device instead of being sent to a server, so it’s safer.

Example: Autonomous drones use Edge AI to make real-time decisions without waiting for cloud servers. This keeps data private and makes reactions quicker.


QUESTION 2: Compare Quantum AI and classical AI in solving optimization problems. What industries could benefit most from Quantum AI?

ANSWERS:
-Classical AI uses regular computers and works well for small or medium problems.
-Quantum AI uses quantum computing. It can try many solutions at once, making it much faster for big, complex problems.

Industries that benefit:
-Logistics (like finding best delivery routes)
-Finance (for managing risks and portfolios)
-Drug discovery and materials science

QUESTION 3: Discuss the societal impact of Human-AI collaboration in healthcare. How might it transform roles like radiologists or nurses?

-Human-AI Collaboration means people and AI work together to improve care.
-AI helps by doing repetitive tasks fast, like reading X-rays or tracking patient records.
-Radiologists can focus more on diagnosis since AI flags issues.
-Nurses get help with monitoring patients and managing schedules.

Impact: Jobs change, but don’t disappear. Humans still make final decisions. Patients may get better, faster care


TASK 2: CASE STUDY CRITIQUES: 

TOPIC: AI in Smart Cities
    Analyze: How does integrating AI with IoT improve urban sustainability? Identify two challenges (e.g., data security).


AI + IoT improves sustainability by:
-Making traffic flow smoother → less fuel used
-Reducing pollution and travel time
-Lowering energy use in street lights and public transport

Two Challenges:

-Data Security: Lots of personal data collected → risk of hacking
-High Cost: Setting up AI and IoT systems is expensive for cities
