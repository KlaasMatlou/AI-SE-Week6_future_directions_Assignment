# Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine

1.	Identify potential biases in using AI to recommend treatments (e.g., underrepresentation of ethnic groups).

2.	Suggest fairness strategies (e.g., diverse training data).

AI is increasingly used in personalized medicine to recommend cancer treatments based on genomic data, such as from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). However, these systems can unintentionally reinforce biases.
One major issue is data bias . Most genomic datasets are built from patients of European descent, leading to underrepresentation of other ethnic groups. This can result in less accurate treatment recommendations for minority populations, worsening health disparities.
Another concern is algorithmic bias . If an AI model is trained mostly on data from one group, it may not perform well for others. For example, genetic markers linked to drug response can vary across populations, and models that ignore this may give incorrect or harmful advice.
To promote fairness, several strategies can be used. First, include diverse populations in training data by expanding data collection globally and ensuring representation across age, gender, and ethnicity. Second, use bias detection tools to test models before deployment and identify performance gaps across groups. Third, apply fairness-aware machine learning techniques , such as reweighting data or using adversarial training, to reduce bias in predictions.
Transparency is also key. Researchers should clearly report the demographic makeup of training data and model performance across groups. Finally, involving ethicists and patient advocates in AI development helps ensure that ethical concerns are addressed early.
In conclusion, while AI has great potential to improve cancer care, it must be developed responsibly. By addressing data and algorithmic biases and promoting fairness, we can build more trustworthy and inclusive AI tools for personalized medicine.
